# Performance claims, and how each is measured

**Status: no measurements exist yet. Every number below is a target to be set, not a
result.** This file exists so that claims are written down *before* benchmarks are chosen,
which is the only order in which a benchmark can falsify anything.

## The claim, stated so a hostile reader can check it

> Nazm compiles through LLVM for release builds, so on scalar single-threaded code it
> targets **parity with C, Rust, and Zig — not a win**.
>
> Where Nazm is designed to win:
> - **Layout-bound workloads**, measured against **both idiomatic Rust and hand-written SoA
>   Rust**. Beating only idiomatic Rust measures a different representation, not a better
>   compiler.
> - **Allocation-heavy workloads vs Go**: throughput and p99.9 latency, no GC.
> - **Scripts vs Python**.
>
> Nazm does not claim to beat C on scalar code.

**All numeric targets are provisional until baselines are measured.** An earlier draft
asserted "geomean within 1.05× of Rust and 1.10× of C" and "any loss beyond 1.2× is a
tracked bug". Those are removed rather than left standing: there is no measured
distribution to set them against, so they were decoration.

## Where the headroom actually is

Ranked by expected payoff. Only the first is a genuine differentiator.

| Lever | Expected payoff | Against | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Data-oriented layout selection (auto SoA, field reorder, hot/cold split) | large on layout-bound code | C, Rust, Zig, Go | the one real unlock — and unproven |
| Escape analysis + region/arena inference, no GC | large on allocation-heavy code; p99.9 latency | Go, Java, Python | high |
| Comptime + whole-program specialisation | moderate | Go interfaces, C++ vtables | medium-high |
| No-alias from the ownership model | small | C | medium — Rust has this and has struggled to cash it |
| Runtime quality (scheduler, allocator, no false sharing) | tail latency, not throughput | Go | medium |
| PGO / JIT respecialisation | moderate, branchy code | everyone | expensive, stage late |
| Auto-vectorisation | ~zero as a differentiator | nobody | **do not market this.** LLVM already does it; wins attributed to it are usually the layout lever giving the vectoriser something it can use |

Avoiding LLVM's compile-time cost is a **compile-time** lever. It does not belong in a
runtime performance claim, and Cranelift output is meaningfully slower than LLVM `-O2`.

## What will make Nazm slower than C for a long time

The standard library. A young `HashMap` loses to `hashbrown`, and library quality compounds
across a whole program.

An earlier draft said "real programs are 80% library calls" and predicted a three-year
disadvantage. Both are removed — the percentage was unsupported and the duration was a
guess presented as a forecast.

## Measurement rules

1. **Layout wins are measured against hand-written SoA Rust**, not only idiomatic Rust.
2. **Compile time and runtime are reported separately.** They trade against each other.
3. **Agent development efficiency is reported separately from both**, under
   [`evaluation.md`](evaluation.md). Go is a runtime reference there, not an arm.
4. **The task-memory benchmark states its terms**: task states distinguished (created /
   parked / runnable / running), stack allocation strategy, lazy commit, **RSS measured
   rather than virtual reservation**, page size recorded per platform.
5. Every published figure carries the machine, toolchain version, and commit hash.
