# Nazm language specification

**Status: this is not yet a specification — it is the list of decisions a specification
has to make, with the ones already settled marked as such.**

**The current executable language is v0.3.** Sections are versioned and kept in order, so
a *Settled for v0.1* entry records what v0.1 decided, not what is true now; where a later
version changed one, the earlier entry says so and points forward. Everything under *Open*
is undecided.

Publishing the open questions before the answers is deliberate. Every one of them was
either wrong or unstated in an earlier draft of the design, and the cost of discovering
that after 150k lines of compiler is the entire reason this document exists first.

---

## Settled

These are design commitments. Changing one is a re-founding decision, not an edit.

1. **Source of truth is plain UTF-8 `.nz` files in git.** Content addressing applies to
   derived artifacts only. (`architecture.md` §3)
2. **Field access is a symbolic projection through Mono MIR.** Byte offsets exist only at
   LIR. Without this, automatic layout selection is unrecoverable. (`architecture.md` §2)
3. **No lifetime syntax in the surface language.** Mutable value semantics with parameter
   conventions `let` / `inout` / `sink` / `set`, checked intraprocedurally. The IR carries
   a full region calculus anyway, as a hedge. (`architecture.md` §5)
4. **Effect rows are inferred and polymorphic.** Colouring is prevented by polymorphism
   over the effect variable, not by hiding the distinction.
5. **Taint is position-sensitive.** Untrusted data in a bound-parameter position is legal;
   in a query-construction position it is an error.
6. **The structured-concurrency borrow region is `[spawn point, scope end]`**, with parent
   and sibling access rejected throughout — not merely at the join.
7. **Purity is a prerequisite, not a licence.** An empty effect row does not by itself
   authorise dropping, reordering, memoizing, or parallelising a call.

## Settled for v0.1 — the executable subset

These are the decisions the first interpreter needs and no more. Each is chosen for the
same reason: **a reader should be able to predict what a line does from the line and the
compiler's response to it.** Where two designs are defensible, the one that removes a
question wins over the one that adds an option.

### Integer overflow — traps, identically in every build

`Int` is 64-bit signed. Overflow is an error that stops the program, in development and in
release alike.

Wrapping silently is the classic source of a bug nobody reads: the arithmetic looks
correct and the number is wrong much later. Differing between debug and release is worse
— it makes a class of bug reproducible only where it cannot be debugged. Trapping costs a
check per operation, which matters for a language claiming performance, and the escape
hatch when it does is an explicit wrapping operator, not a build flag.

### Division by zero — an error, not a value and not undefined

`/` and `%` by zero stop the program with a diagnostic. Not a NaN-like sentinel, which
propagates silently; not undefined behaviour, which is unrepresentable in a language with
no `unsafe` yet.

### Shadowing — allowed in a nested scope, refused in the same one

```nazm
let x = 1;
let x = 2;        // error: `x` is already defined in this scope
if c { let x = 3; }   // fine: a different scope
```

Rust permits same-scope shadowing and it is genuinely convenient. It is refused here
because of what it does to *reading a change*: when a later line mentions `x`, telling
which binding it means requires scanning upward for every intervening `let`. A diff that
inserts one silently changes the meaning of code it does not touch.

### Argument evaluation order — left to right, specified

Specified, not "unspecified for optimisation". Unspecified order is a licence for two
correct compilers to disagree, and the resulting bug appears only after a toolchain
upgrade. v0.1 has no side effects for the order to be observable through, which is
precisely why it costs nothing to fix it now and would be a breaking change later.

### Function returns — the final expression, and nothing else

A function body is a block; the block's value is its final expression; that is the return
value. There is no `return` statement in v0.1.

One exit point means the value a function produces is always in the same place. `return`
earns its keep with guard clauses, and it is not ruled out — it is deferred until there is
something to guard against.

> **Superseded in v0.3.** `return` exists and is implemented — see [`return`](#return)
> below. This entry is kept rather than edited because it records what v0.1 committed to
> and why, and the reasoning ("deferred until there is something to guard against") is
> what the later section answers. **The current executable language is v0.3**; a function's
> value is still its final expression, and `return` is for the paths that leave early.

### Types — `Int`, `Bool`, `Str`, and no inference across function boundaries

Parameter and return types are always written. Local `let` bindings infer from their
initialiser. Both branches of an `if` must have the same type, and a condition must be
`Bool` — there is no truthiness.

## Settled for v0.2 — mutation and iteration

### Mutation is opt-in and visible at the binding

```nazm
let x = 1;        // immutable
let mut n = 0;    // mutable
n = n + 1;        // assignment is a statement
x = 2;            // error: `x` is not mutable
```

Immutable by default, `mut` to opt in. The alternative — mutable by default with a `const`
opt-out — puts the annotation on the rarer case and makes the common one silent, so a
reader has to check every binding to know whether a later line can change it.

Assignment is a **statement**, not an expression. It has no value, so `if (x = 1) { … }`
does not parse. That is one of the oldest C bugs and there is nothing to gain by
reproducing it.

**Parameters are not mutable**, and `fn f(mut x: Int)` is refused by name. A mutable
parameter is a local copy, which looks like an out-parameter to anyone who has not checked
the calling convention. A `let mut` inside the body says the same thing without the
ambiguity.

Assignment does not change a binding's type: `n` declared from an `Int` stays `Int`.

### `while` is a statement, and there is no loop value

```nazm
fn sum_to(n: Int) -> Int {
    let mut total = 0;
    let mut i = 1;
    while i <= n {
        total = total + i;
        i = i + 1;
    }
    total
}
```

A loop has no natural value. The two ways to give it one are a unit type or an arbitrary
rule, and a unit type is a real decision with consequences for function returns and block
tails — too large to make in passing for the sake of `while`. So a block is *statements
followed by a tail expression*, and `while` is a statement. The tail is still required.

The condition must be `Bool`. There is still no truthiness.

### One block, and completion decided by checking

A block is **statements followed by an optional tail expression**. There is one `Block`
and one `if`; whether either produces a value is determined when checking, not by which
syntactic form was parsed.

The tail is simply *an expression not followed by `;`*:

```nazm
{ let x = 1; x }      // tail: the block's value is `x`
{ let x = 1; x; }     // no tail: `x;` is a statement, the block has no value
{ if c { a() } }      // tail: the `if`'s value is the block's
{ if c { a(); } d }   // the `if` is a statement; `d` is the tail
```

A block-like expression — `if`, `while`, a bare `{ … }` — needs no `;` in statement
position, so `if c { x = 1; }` followed by more statements reads naturally.

An earlier version had two of everything: an expression block and a statement block, an
`if` expression and an `if` statement, and a function that scanned forward balancing braces
to guess which `if` it was looking at. That guess had a case it got wrong, and every
construct added afterwards would have needed its own place in it. **This is the replacement
and the scanner is gone.**

Checking gives each block one of three completions, which are internal — the language has
no `unit` or `never` type to write:

| completion | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **value** | falls off the end with a value of some type |
| **unit** | falls off the end with no value |
| **diverges** | never falls off the end: every path `return`s, `break`s or `continue`s |

A function body must complete with a value of the declared type, or diverge. An `if` used
where a value is wanted must have both branches, and they must agree — unless one diverges,
in which case the other decides. Unreachable code is a statement after one that diverges.

### `break` and `continue`, and the `if` they force

```nazm
while i < n {
    if skip(i) {
        i = i + 1;
        continue;
    }
    if done(i) { break; }
    total = total + i;
    i = i + 1;
}
```

Both are **statements**, they affect the **innermost** enclosing loop, and there are no
labels. `continue` re-evaluates the condition.

They are only legal inside a loop body, and **only in statement position**. `break` is not
an expression and has no value, so `let x = break;` and `if c { break } else { 1 }` do not
parse. Rust gives `break` the never type and makes this work; a never type is a real
addition with consequences for every other inference rule, and it is not worth adding so
that `break` can sit in an expression it has no business being in.

`while c { if d { break; } }` works because a block's tail is optional: `{ break; }`
completes by diverging, which is not the same as completing with no value, and neither is
an error unless something wanted a value from it.

### `return`

```nazm
fn classify(n: Int) -> Str {
    if n < 0 {
        return "negative";
    }
    if n == 0 {
        return "zero";
    }
    "positive"
}
```

`return expression;` leaves the enclosing **function**, not merely the enclosing loop, and
its value must match the declared return type. A function whose every path returns needs no
tail expression.

**`return;` with no value is not supported.** It would need a unit type to mean anything,
and that is a decision this language has not made. Refused by name.

A function's value is still its final expression; `return` is for the paths that leave
early, which is the case it earns its keep on.

**`return` is a statement, but a block is an expression**, so a `return` may sit inside
anything used as a value:

```nazm
let x = if n > 0 { return 1; } else { 2 };
let y = g(if n > 0 { return 7; } else { 2 });
while (if n > 0 { return 4; } else { i < 3 }) { … }
```

Each of these leaves the function. The enclosing expression has no value and never will,
so evaluation of it stops where the `return` was raised: in `1 + if c { return 5; } else
{ 2 }`, the left operand has already been evaluated and the addition never happens. The
same applies to `break` and `continue` in a value position, and to a `return` nested
inside another — the inner one leaves first, so the outer never gets a value to return.

This follows from the checker rather than being a separate rule: a diverging branch takes
the other branch's type, which is what makes these programs well-typed in the first place.
An evaluator that refused them would be rejecting programs the type system accepts.

### Code after `break`, `continue` or `return` is an error

```nazm
while c {
    break;
    i = i + 1;   // error: this can never run
}
```

An error rather than a warning, because this language has no warning severity yet and
silence is the wrong default for a statement that provably cannot execute. Relaxing an
error to a warning later is a compatible change; tightening a warning to an error is not,
so the strict choice is the reversible one.

### The iteration and depth limits are the interpreter's, not the language's

With no `break` and no I/O, a non-terminating program produces nothing at all. A tool that
hangs is worse than one that reports, so `nazm run` stops and says so — after a
configurable number of loop iterations (`--max-iterations`, default 10,000,000) or nested
calls (`--max-depth`, default 512).

Both are needed, and one does not imply the other: `fn f(n: Int) -> Int { f(n) }` never
loops, so the iteration budget never sees it. Unbounded, it exhausts the host stack and
kills the process with no diagnostic at all — the one failure a tool cannot explain.

**A bound only means something against a known stack**, and a library cannot know its
caller's: macOS gives the main thread 8 MiB, a spawned thread 2 MiB, and the test harness
2 MiB per test. So the interpreter runs the whole pipeline — parsing, checking, evaluating
and dropping the tree — on a thread whose stack it sets itself, and **sizes that stack from
the budget it is about to enforce**: `24 MiB + max_depth × 32 KiB`. Raising `--max-depth`
raises the reservation with it, so the guarantee holds above the default rather than only
at it. A machine that will not grant the reservation says so (`N0404`) instead of failing
part-way in, and a budget past `1,000,000` is refused with the figure it would have cost.

The per-call figure is measured, not guessed: about 6.6 KB per nested call for ordinary
code on a debug build and about 17 KB for deliberately heavy frames, doubled to 32 KiB. A
test recurses to the bound and requires a diagnostic, so a construct that made frames dear
enough to close the gap fails the suite rather than surfacing as an abort in a terminal.

### Nesting is bounded at parse time, which bounds every pass after it

Call depth is not the only way to run out of stack. `((((1))))`, `- - - - 1` and
`{ { { 1 } } }` recurse through the parser, the checker, the evaluator **and the destructor
of the tree itself**, without a single call frame in the program — so a call-depth budget
never sees them, and `nazm check` never reaches the evaluator at all.

**The syntax tree may be 512 deep** (`N0102`), measured as it is built: every node
records `1 + max(children)`, so the bound is on the tree the later passes walk rather than
an estimate of it. Parsing is the only pass that can report rather than abort, so that is
where the limit lives. Reported once per item, not once per level.

A *second* bound, the same size, applies to the parser's own recursion, because the parser
is a stack consumer too and the two are not the same measurement. Parentheses build no
node — `((((1))))` is a tree of depth 2 however many there are — so only the recursion
bound constrains them. Conversely `1 + 1 + …` is parsed by a loop that never recurses, and
only the tree bound constrains it.

Getting this wrong is easy and was got wrong first. Counting parser recursion alone looked
sufficient, and was not: in `- - - 1 + 1 + 1` the operand is parsed and its levels released
*before* the chain of `+` starts counting, so the peak count is the larger of the two while
the tree is as deep as both together. A test that measured the tree rather than the counter
found one accepted at 1022 against a limit of 512, and composing the shapes would have
compounded it further. The bound is now exact because it is taken from the nodes
themselves; the tests check the deepest tree accepted for every pairing of seven shapes,
each pair probed at its own edge rather than somewhere comfortably inside it.

512 is far past anything written by hand. It is not far past what a generator emits: Nazm
has no `else if`, so a dispatch chain written as `else { if … }` costs two levels an arm.
A limit tight enough for a 2 MiB stack would have been about 64, which is a real constraint
on real code — so the stack is raised instead, and `parse_source` states the requirement it
cannot enforce. The worst shape measured is nested blocks, at about 14 KB per level; the
tests parse the deepest tree the parser accepts, for four shapes, on exactly the documented
stack, finding each shape's edge by asking the parser rather than by counting levels.

Neither budget is a language rule. Nazm bounds neither iteration nor recursion, and the
nesting limit is the parser's; this implementation has all three so that a runaway program
fails visibly instead of consuming a machine. A different implementation may choose
differently.

**`nazm build` is that different implementation, and it has chosen none of them.** A
compiled program has no iteration budget and no call-depth budget: a loop whose condition
never becomes false runs until something kills it, with no `N0402`. This is stated here so
that the difference is part of the record rather than a discovery. The two implementations
agree on what a *terminating* program produces; they do not agree on what a runaway one
does, and no test claims otherwise. Recursion is refused outright by that backend for the
related reason — see `docs/roadmap.md`, *Recursion: pending a native execution contract*.

### The integer boundaries, stated rather than inherited

Two's complement is asymmetric — there is one more negative `Int` than positive — and
every language that leaves the consequences to the hardware gets a rule with an exception
in it. Nazm states all four cases:

| expression | result | why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-9223372036854775808` | the smallest `Int` | The sign folds into the literal. The magnitude alone is out of range, so lexing the digits and negating afterwards would make the smallest `Int` unwritable — an arbitrary hole in the range |
| `-9223372036854775809` | error, out of range | The fold checks the magnitude rather than assuming any digits after `-` will fit |
| `-x` where `x` is the smallest `Int` | **traps** | The result has no representation. Traps in every build, like all overflow |
| `x / -1` where `x` is the smallest `Int` | **traps** | The quotient is one past the largest `Int`. On x86 this faults in hardware; a checked division is what turns it into a diagnostic instead of a dead process |
| `x % -1` where `x` is the smallest `Int` | **0** | Mathematically zero, and zero is representable. The same hardware instruction faults on it and Rust's `checked_rem` reports nothing, but inheriting that would make the rule *"`%` fails on a zero divisor, and also on one exact pair of operands"* — a wart to memorise for no gain |

The through-line: `%` has exactly one failure case, a zero divisor. Overflow traps
wherever the result genuinely cannot be represented, and nowhere else.

### One mistake, one error

A parse error inside a function body does not delete the function. Its signature is kept,
so calls to it still check against real parameter and return types instead of reporting
that it does not exist — which would be several errors for one mistake, the exact failure
this language is meant to avoid. Nothing is said about the body itself: statements that
were never built would be claims about the parser's guess, not about the program.

### Not in v0.3, and unsupported rather than half-present

Valueless `return`, labelled break, `for`, `loop`, mutable parameters, effects, I/O,
generics, user-defined types, modules, string concatenation, floating point. A program using any of them is
rejected by name rather than misparsed into something else.

`nazm run` prints the value of `main`. There is deliberately no `print`: output is an
effect, effects are the design's central mechanism, and a builtin that bypassed the effect
system before it exists would be the wrong shape to unpick later.

## Open — later phases must settle these

### Memory and values

- Exact copy semantics: when is a value copied, when projected, when moved?
- Closure capture: which conventions may a closure capture under, and what escapes?
- Copy elision: what does the compiler *guarantee*, versus what does it merely usually do?
  MVS is unusable if this is folklore.
- Arena/region assignment rules, and how region inference interacts with the exclusivity
  check when they are (by design) the same solve.

### Effects

- **Is divergence an effect?** The `forever()` counterexample in `architecture.md` §5 shows
  that without an answer, "drop an unused pure call" is unsound. Options: treat divergence
  as an effect; track termination separately (`willreturn`-style); or refuse the
  transformation entirely.
- Is allocation failure an effect, a panic, or a return value?
- Is panic an effect, an unwind, or both, and what is observable about it?
- Evaluation order: specified, or deliberately unspecified? If unspecified, differential
  testing across backends cannot compare it (`architecture.md` §6).
- Which handlers lower statically, and which require one-shot continuation capture?

### Provenance and information flow

- Implicit flows: is branching on a `Secret` a leak? Full non-interference is usually
  unusable in practice; what is the chosen approximation, and what does it miss?
- Sanitizer functions: how are they declared, and what stops a no-op being declared one?
- Aliasing: how does a label propagate through a projection?
- Declassification: which capability, granted where, audited how?
- The FFI boundary: what label does a value returned from C carry?

### Concurrency

- Captured variables, globals/statics, and foreign pointers are **not** covered by channel
  ownership transfer. Each needs a rule.
- Preemption: cooperative at back-edges and calls, or signal-based?
- What exactly does cancellation cancel, and what cleanup is guaranteed to run?

### Layout selection

- The eligibility predicate: which types may the compiler re-lay-out?
- Behaviour under address identity, escaping references, FFI, serialization, atomics, and
  separate compilation (`architecture.md` §4).

### Backend semantics

Required before `nazm test --backend=all` means anything:

- integer overflow behaviour
- floating-point semantics (fast-math? reassociation? NaN payloads?)
- panic and unwind behaviour
- what counts as an observable output

### Syntax

- The surface syntax itself, which is the **largest lever against the training-data risk**
  and is nearly free to change now and effectively unchangeable later. Novelty is a budget:
  spend it only where it buys semantics unobtainable otherwise.
- A machine-readable grammar (needed as a spec artifact regardless of whether
  grammar-constrained decoding is ever used).
- A cheatsheet under ~3k tokens, to be injected by `nazm init`.

## Non-goals for the current interpreter milestone

Deliberately out of scope:

macros · comptime beyond constant folding · general effect handlers · whole-program taint ·
layout selection · a package manager · a module system beyond files

**Self-hosting was on this list and has been moved off it.** It is now a stated long-term
objective — see [`direction.md`](direction.md) — and it remains outside this milestone,
which is a different thing from being a non-goal. The staged path is
[`roadmap.md`](roadmap.md) M3, and it is deliberately preceded by M2: the language has no
collections, no user-defined types, no pattern matching, no string concatenation and no
I/O, so a compiler cannot be written in it yet at all.
